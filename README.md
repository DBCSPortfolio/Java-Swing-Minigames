# Java-Swing-Minigames
A collection of small game applications using Swing to create GUIs - for an "Intermediate Java" course.

The files in this repository are from two assignments for an Intermediate Java course. They are quite basic, but served as good practice in using Swing to create GUIs for software applications.

Feel free to download and play any of them! Included are:

- A very basic version of Battleship

- Tic-tac-toe

- A game called "Catch the Mouse," in which one "X" character repeatedly appears in a random cell among a field of blank cells, and the user must click the cell with the "X" 10 times in a row to win

- A lottery game in which the user selects 6 numbers from a selection and may win money based on how many of their numbers matched 6 numbers randomly selected by the computer

- A game called "Lucky Seven," in which there are 7 buttons numbered 1-7 and with the numbers 1-7 hidden randomly underneath. At the beginning, the user clicks one button, and this reveals a number; the user must then click the button matching this number. The game ends if a button with a number matching a revealed number has already been clicked. The goal is to click all buttons without the game ending.
